SCIP version 0.75
=================
- started change log


current SCIP version
====================

interface:
- new method SCIPchgVarBranchDirection()
- new method SCIPvarGetBranchDirection()
- new possible result code SCIP_DELAYED for primal heuristics

parameters:
- new parameter separating/efficacynorm to choose between euclidean, maximum, sum, and discrete norm
  in efficacy calculation
- changed default frequency offset of pscostdiving (heuristics/pscostdiving/freqofs) to 2,
  and frequency offset of fracdiving (heuristics/feaspump/freqofs) to 0 in order to not call pscostdiving
  in root node, where nearly all pseudo costs are uninitialized

features:
- creation of reconvergence clauses in conflict analysis
- first node of each plunging is not treated as plunging node w.r.t. calling primal heuristics

fixed bugs:
- removed bugs in CLP Solver interface
- SCIP returned "gap limit reached" even if the problem was solved to optimality, if the
  optimal solution was found at a node with lower bound equal to the global lower bound

known bugs (still not fixed):
- air04 and air05 return wrong optimal value (1 too large): possibly due to strong branching or setppc propagation?
