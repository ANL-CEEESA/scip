In the following, some of the names depend on your machine and your
compilation settings:

- $(OSTYPE): the operating system
             the string returned by "uname -s" in lower case

- $(ARCH):   the architecture
             the string returned by "uname -m", modified by the following
             rules to subsume some architectures:
              - "sun??" is replaced by "sparc"
              - "i?86" is replaced by "x86"
              - "IP??" is replaced by "mips"
              - "9000????" is replaced by "hppa"
              - "00??????????" is replaced by "pwr4"

- $(COMP):   the compiler
             "gnu", "intel", "compaq", "sun", "insure", ... (see make/ directory)

- $(OPT):    the optimization level of compilation
             "dbg", "opt", or "prf"

For example, if you want to install SCIP on a Linux system with a x86 processor
using the gnu compiler in debug mode, you would have the following names:
- $(OSTYPE) = linux
- $(ARCH)   = x86
- $(COMP)   = gnu
- $(OPT)    = dbg

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is what you have to do to get SCIP running:

1. Create necessary softlinks in lib/ directory:
   (a) to use CPLEX (Version >= 8.0)
       - ln -s <path to directory of cplex.h> lib/cpxinc
         (e.g. "ln -s /cplex90/include/ilcplex lib/cpxinc")
       - ln -s <file libcplex.a> lib/libcplex.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).a
         for each operation system and architecture to use
         (e.g. "ln -s /cplex90/lib/i86_linux2_glibc2.3_gcc3.2/static_pic/libcplex.a lib/libcplex.linux.x86.a")
   (b) to use SOPLEX (Version >= 1.2.2)
       - ln -s <path to SOPLEX' *.h files> lib/spxinc
       - ln -s <file libsoplex.[...].a> lib/libsoplex.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).a
         for each operating system and architecture to use
         (e.g. "ln -s /soplex/lib/libsoplex.linux.x86.gnu.opt.a lib/libsoplex.linux.x86.a")
   (c) to use SOPLEX (Version <= 1.2.1)
       - ln -s <path to SOPLEX' *.h files> lib/spx121inc
       - ln -s <file libsoplex.[...].a> lib/libsoplex121.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).a
         for each operating system and architecture to use
         (e.g. "ln -s /soplex121/lib/libsoplex.linux.x86.gnu.opt.a lib/libsoplex121.linux.x86.a")
   (d) to use CLP
       - ln -s <path to CLP's and COIN's *.h files> lib/clpinc
         (e.g. "ln -s /COIN/include lib/clpinc")
       - ln -s <file libClp.a> lib/libclp.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).a
         for each operating system and architecture to use
         (e.g. "ln -s /COIN/lib/libClp.a lib/libclp.linux.x86.a")
       - ln -s <file libCoin.a> lib/libcoin.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).a
         for each operating system and architecture to use
         (e.g. "ln -s /COIN/lib/libCoin.a lib/libcoin.linux.x86.a")

2. Compile the library and the solver program:
   In your SCIP main directory, enter "make OPT=<...> LPS=<...> COMP=<...>" with
   the following options:
   - "OPT=dbg"     to use debug compilation mode (default)
   - "OPT=opt"     to use optimized compilation mode
   - "OPT=prf"     to use performance analysis compilation mode
   - "LPS=cpx"     to use CPLEX as LP solver (default)
   - "LPS=spx"     to use SOPLEX Version >= 1.2.2 as LP solver
   - "LPS=spx121"  to use SOPLEX Version <= 1.2.1 as LP solver
   - "LPS=clp"     to use CLP as LP solver
   - "COMP=gnu"    to use GNU c/c++ compiler (default)
   - other compilers are available (see make/ directory)

3. To run the program enter "bin/scip.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).$(OPT)"
   (e.g. "bin/scip.linux.x86.gnu.dbg.cpx")

4. To generate the documentation, you need to have doxygen installed, and
   enter "make doc"

5. To check the code with lint, you need to have flexelint installed, and
   enter "make lint"

On some machines, you should use gmake instead of make.
