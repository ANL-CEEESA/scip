Licensing Information For Commercial Users
------------------------------------------

SCIP and SoPlex can be used without charge for academic purposes. ZIB
also promotes the transfer of mathematics into industrial applications
and is interested in commercial applications of SCIP and SoPlex. If
you are applying SCIP/SoPlex in such a context, you need a
license. The basic conditions for such a license are laid out in the
following.


1. When a Commercial License is Needed.

   The basic rule is: whenever you add value by using SCIP, you need a
   license. This includes:

   - selling a product that includes (parts) of SCIP/SoPlex, also in linked
     binary form
   - selling results that were obtained by using SCIP/SoPlex
   - using SCIP/SoPlex internally to save money
   - applying for grants for which SCIP/SoPlex is an integral part


2. License Fees

   The license for SCIP includes the license for SoPlex as well, but
   you can also obtain a license for SoPlex alone.

   - A development license costs about 2000 Euro.
   - Selling SCIP/SoPlex with a binary code, costs about 1000 Euro per
     code license; for larger quantities the fee reduces.
   
   The fees can be reduced in special situations, depending on
   negotiation. This point might apply, for example, if the price of
   the original product is small or within an academic cooperation.


3. Licensing Conditions

   SCIP/SoPlex and to distribute SCIP/SoPlex in added value

   the right to distribute a general purpose MIP, LP, or CP library or
