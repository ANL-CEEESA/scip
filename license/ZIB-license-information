Licensing Information For Commercial Users
------------------------------------------

SCIP and SoPlex can be used without charge for academic purposes. ZIB
also promotes the transfer of mathematics into industrial applications
and is interested in commercial applications of SCIP and SoPlex. 

If you are applying SCIP/SoPlex in such a context, you need a
commercial license from ZIB. The basic conditions for such a license
are laid out in the following.


1. When a Commercial License is Needed

   The basic rule is: whenever you add value by using SCIP, you need a
   license. This includes:

   - selling a product that includes (parts) of SCIP/SoPlex in linked
     binary form
   - selling results that were obtained by using SCIP/SoPlex
   - using SCIP/SoPlex internally for nonacademic purposes


2. License Fees

   The license for SCIP includes the license for SoPlex as well, but
   you can also obtain a license for SoPlex alone.

   - A development license costs about 2000 Euro.
   - Selling SCIP/SoPlex with a binary code costs about 1000 Euro per
     copy sold; for larger quantities the fee reduces.
   
   The fees can be reduced in special situations, depending on
   negotiation. This point might apply, for example, if the price of
   the original product is small or SCIP/SoPlex is used within an
   academic cooperation.

   A particular situation that has to be negotiated is when you are
   from an academic institution and are applying for grants for which
   SCIP/SoPlex is an integral part


3. Licensing Conditions

   <Your company> obtains a perpetual and non exclusive license to use
   SCIP/SoPlex and to distribute SCIP/SoPlex in added value
   products. <Your company> does not have the right to distribute a
   general purpose MIP, LP, or CP library or an MIP/LP/CP solver based
   on SCIP/SoPlex. ZIB's own rights to use and distribute SCIP/SoPlex
   are not affected by this agreement.

   ZIB takes no guarantee for the function of SCIP/SoPlex, and no
   liability for any consequences that the use of SCIP/SoPlex in
   products of <your company> or at <your company> itself may have.
   ZIB also does not guarantee that SCIP/SoPlex is useful for any
   purpose whatsoever.

   <Your company> has the right to distribute all or parts of
   SCIP/SoPlex or modifications thereof in binary form in its
   products.


4. Maintenance And Support

   SCIP/SoPlex is sold "as is", no release is provided.

   ZIB is an academic institution and not a commercial company. We do
   not offer maintenance nor support. We are, however, always
   interested in reported bugs and will try to fix them, but we will
   not guarantee to do so.

5. Test Licences

   ZIB may grant a test license for a limited time upon request that
   allows to test SCIP/SoPlex for internal purposes. We of course hope
   that this will lead to a regular license.
