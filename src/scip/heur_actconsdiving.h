/**@file   heur_actconsdiving.h

 * @brief  LP diving heuristic that chooses fixings w.r.t. the active constraints the variable appear in
 * @author Tobias Achterberg
 *
 * Diving heuristic: Iteratively fixes some fractional variable and resolves the LP-relaxation, thereby simulating a
 * depth-first-search in the tree. Active Constraint Diving chooses a variable based on the active LP rows (equations
 * are counted twice here).  The variable score is calculated as a convex combination of the number of constraints the
 * variable appears in, the sum of all positive coefficients and the absolute sum of all negative coefficients. The
 * chosen variable is then rounded to the closest integer. One-level backtracking is applied: If the LP gets infeasible,
 * the last fixings is undone, and the opposite fixing is tried. If this is infeasible, too, the procedure aborts.
