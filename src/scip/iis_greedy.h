/**@file   iis_greedy.h
 * @brief  greedy deletion and addition filter heuristic to compute IISs
 * @author Marc Pfetsch
 * @author Mark Turner
 *
 * An irreducibly infeasible subsystem (IIS) is a subset of the constraints that is infeasible and (set-wise) minimial
 * in this respect.
 * The deletion filter heuristic greedily removes constraints and checks whether the remaining problem
 * is still infeasible.
 * The addition filter heuristic greedily adds constraints from an empty problem until the problem becomes
 * infeasible. The deletion filter can then be applied as a post-processing step.
 * The method is based on
 *
 * O. Guieu and J. Chinneck, Analyzing infeasible mixed-integer and integer linear programs,@p
 * INFORMS J. Comput. 11, no. 1 (1999), pp. 63â€“77.
 *
 * If the appropriate parameters are set then we can guarantee that the result is minimal, i.e.,
 * an irreducible infeasible subsystem (IIS). Otherwise we may only obtain an infeasible subsystem (IS).
 * For no settings can guarantee the smallest possible infeasible subsystem.
